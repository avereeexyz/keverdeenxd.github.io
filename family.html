      <h2>My Loved Ones</h2>
      <p>Family is everything to me. It is the foundation of who I am and who I continue to strive to be.</p>

      <h3>Meet Mimi Webb</h3>
      <p>My fiancée, Mimi Webb, is not only my partner but my biggest inspiration. She brings creativity, joy, and love into my life. We've been through so much together, and I'm grateful for every moment spent by her side.</p>

      <h3>Meet Mia</h3>
      <p>Our beautiful daughter, Mia, was born on January 4, 2026. She is my heart and soul, and she has already brought so much happiness to our family.</p>

      <h3>Our Family Values</h3>
      <p>We believe in love, support, and always being there for one another. These values are what guide us as we raise our daughter together.</p>
